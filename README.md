Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This repository contains several small projects that I have developed in Python.

Included Projects:

1. Hangman Game

A game where the user must guess a word letter by letter.

A word is randomly chosen from a list.

The user enters a letter in each turn.

The game continues until the word is completely guessed.

2. Rock-Paper-Scissors

A simple version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer.

The user chooses between 0 (Rock), 1 (Paper), and 2 (Scissors).

The computer makes a random choice.

The program determines the winner.

3. Pizza Shop

A program simulating a pizza order with additional options.

The user selects the size of their pizza (S, M, or E).

They can add extras like pepperoni and a drink.

The total cost is calculated and displayed.

4. Password Generator

A program that generates a secure password based on user input.

The user specifies the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

The program randomly selects characters from predefined lists.

The password is shuffled for added security before being displayed.
