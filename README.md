Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This repository contains several small projects that I have developed in Python inorder to improove my python coding skills.

Included Projects:

1. Hangman Game:
An enhanced version of the classic Hangman game.A word is randomly selected from a predefined list.The player must guess the word letter by letter.The game provides a visual representation of the hangman at each incorrect guess.
The player has a limited number of lives before losing the game.
The art is in hangman_logo.py

2. Rock-Paper-Scissors:
A simple version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer.The user chooses between 0 (Rock), 1 (Paper), and 2 (Scissors).The computer makes a random choice.The program determines the winner.

3. Pizza Shop:
A program simulating a pizza order with additional options.The user selects the size of their pizza (S, M, or E).They can add extras like pepperoni and a drink.The total cost is calculated and displayed.

4. Password Generator:
A program that generates a secure password based on user input.The user specifies the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.The program randomly selects characters from predefined lists.The password is shuffled for added security before being displayed.

5. Caesar Cipher:
A program that encrypts and decrypts messages using a shift cipher.The user can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message.
The message is shifted by a user-specified number of positions in the alphabet.The program outputs the encoded or decoded message
The art is in art.py

6.Secret Auction Program:
A program that organizes a secret auction:
Users enter their name and their bid.The program asks if there are any other participants.When all bids are submitted, the program displays the highest bid.
